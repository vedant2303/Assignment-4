# Assignment-4
This is a C++ programme has 2 cpp file and 1 header file. 
This program basically this function performs shakersort algorithm and reports the time in both 
ascending and descending order.

The following is what the program will do
Shaker.h includes three functions:
  1) getVecSize function that will return the size of the vector taken input from the user.
  1) generateVec function, which will generate the vector of the given size and stores it in the file.
  2) readVec function will return the vector that was read from the file.
  3) sortVecAsc function will sort the data in the ascending order and store it in the file.
  4) sortVecDesc function will sort the data in the descending order and store it in the file.
  5) writeVec function will write the sorted data in the output file.

Shaker.cpp includes: 
  1) getVecSize function will return the size of the vector taken input from the user.
  1) generateVec function will generate the vector of the given size and stores it in the file.
  2) readVec function that return's the vector that was read from the file.
  3) sortVecAsc function which will sort the data in the ascending order and store it in the file.
  4) sortVecDesc function which sorts the data in the descending order and store it in the file.
  5) writeVec function that will write the sorted data in the output file.

Main.cpp includes:
  1) This file contains the main() function where the program execution starts.
